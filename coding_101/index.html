<p>A little about me...</p>
<p> I was born Florida, and raised there until I was 13-years-old. When I was close to 14, my family and I moved to Dallas. I lived there up until recently, and have since relocated to Washington DC. I work in nonprofit communications. My hobbies include reading, writing, traveling, being with people I love, and watching classic films.</p>
<p> Here are some of the places I've traveled</p>
